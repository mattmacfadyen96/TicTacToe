# TicTacToe
Text based version of the classic game. This is my first Python project 

# How to play 
Two players can play this on the same computer. You must have Python installed on your computer. Run the Python script 
and select which player wants to go first. X's will always go first. There is also an option to randomly select who goes 
first as well. Once someone wins or there is a tie you will be promopted if you would like to play the game again.
